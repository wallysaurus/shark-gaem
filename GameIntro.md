In the world there is a deadly apocalypse that is occurring on land in Taiwan. Asteroids with record sizes are demolishing cities and destroying vegetation and habitats in separate ecosystems within Taiwan. In the Taipingshan Forest there are three monkeys that reside within this imaginary world. There is the glowrilla, emperor tamarin, and a unique monkey, Xing Xing. When one asteroid hits the forest it lands where these monkeys reside and splits open, revealing rocks displaying ethereal blue and yellow colors (two blue rocks and one yellow rock). The gorilla and emperor tamarin climb into the large asteroid and touch the two blue rocks. As they touch the rocks blue mist surrounds them and supplements their instinctual abilities. Both monkeys now have the ability to breathe underwater and the rocks disappear. Xing Xing touches the yellow rock and yellow mist surrounds her. As the rock disappears, she enlarges to 104 ft. and gains the ability to summon a space nanotech arm by her level of rage and breathe underwater as well. As the asteroids continue to fall into the forest, all the monkeys including Xing Xing run to the Pacific Ocean. As they sink into the ocean they spot an unusual shark with technological attachments to its body. This shark is a Taiwanese government project that is meant to enhance maritime warfare without reliance on naval ships. The shark immediately attacks the monkeys and the game begins.
