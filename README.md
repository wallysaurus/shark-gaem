# Laser Shark Game
Low-Poly battle game made with the Godot game engine. More documentation soon to come.
# Vision Statement

Within the game we are creating, we are making a game with animal interaction with unique abilities that challenge the player's skills. There are three notable characters that the player will need to overcome in order to pass certain levels and win: a glowrilla, emperor tamarin, and Xing Xing (the main boss). The player will go through different segments of the game through playing as a laser shark with ethereal abilities that will appeal to players that prefer rpg games with action based concepts. In order to pass the levels and win the game the player will need to defeat enemies through utilizing their avatar's abilities to hit their enemies a specified number of times which is interdependent with the character you are battling. As the player passes levels, the difficulty increases which means more obstacles and more hits will be needed to overcome the advanced scenarios that are displayed. Our main purpose with creating this game is to combine whimsical concepts with distinct animals that reside in different biomes; the creativity we are trying to develop will establish a game that will cause active engagement and interest among our main audience - teens, kids, and young adults.
